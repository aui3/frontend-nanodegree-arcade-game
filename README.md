Arcade Game Clone

This is my version of the classic arcade game Frogger as part of the third Project in Udacity's Front End Nano Degree Program!

To play the game, follow this link:

Goal:
-Score as High as you can in the given time while avoiding the bugs!

Game Play:

- Hit Start to initiate the game.
- Use the Pause button to Pause the game while it's in play
- Use the Arrow Keys to move the player on the board.
- One game loop runs for 30s as depicted by the Timer.
- Player has a given number of lives, as depicted by the Hearts.
- Collect as many gems, randomly positioned on the enemy's path, as you can before time runs out.
- Each Gem is worth 5 points. There will only be atmost 3 gems available to grab at any time. More gems will continue to appear after player grabs all three until the game ends.  
- Bugs/Enemy move randomly and at random speed on the stone path.
- Collision with the Bug results in loss of life and the player moves back to the initial position.
- Game ends if either the time runs out or the player looses all of their lives.
- Press Restart to begin the game again.
- High Score is the highest score player has achieved in all of the game attempts.
